    <div>
        <p>
            You were selected to receive payment from the {{selected_group}}’s group envelope. 
            Would you like to switch to the envelope coming from the {{switch_group}}’s group envelope instead? 
            If so, what is the maximum number of points you are willing to pay to switch to the {{switch_group}}’s group envelope.    
        </p>
        <p>
            Before this survey, a fee of X points was RANDOMLY generated from between 0 and 5 points in increments of 0.25 points. 
            If the maximum amount you report is greater than X points, the randomly selected fee of X points will be deducted from your final payment, 
            and you will receive the contents of the other envelope instead of the original envelope. 
            This decision and outcome will only be used, and results occur if you correctly guessed the contents of the original {{selected_group}}’s group envelope.
